## About The Project

The User Access Management (UAM) application is a robust, full-stack solution designed to streamline and secure the process of managing user accounts and their access privileges within a system. This tool provides administrators with centralized control over who can access specific resources, defining roles, permissions, and ensuring data integrity and security.

It aims to solve the common challenges of:

  * **Centralized User Control:** Providing a single interface for managing all user-related operations.
  * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implementing a system where access is granted based on predefined roles, simplifying permission management.
  * **Enhanced Security:** Reducing unauthorized access by strictly enforcing permissions.
  * **Auditability:** Offering clear logs for tracking user activities and permission changes.

-----

## Features

Our UAM application comes packed with essential features to manage user access effectively:

  * **User Registration & Authentication:** Secure mechanisms for new user sign-ups and login.
  * **User Profile Management:** Ability for users and administrators to view and update user information.
  * **Role Management:** Create, assign, and manage distinct roles (e.g., Administrator, Manager, User) with specific access levels.
  * **Permission Management:** Granular control over individual permissions that can be assigned to roles or directly to users.
  * **Password Management:** Features for password reset, change, and strong password policies.
  * **Activity Logging:** Comprehensive logging of user actions and administrative changes for auditing purposes.
  * **Search & Filtering:** Easy search and filter capabilities for users, roles, and permissions.

-----

## Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern and powerful technology stack:

  * **Frontend:**
      * [React.js](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  * **Backend:**
      * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
      * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
  * **Database:**
      * **[PostgreSQL]** - For data persistence.
  * **Authentication/Authorization:**
      * [Optional: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Passport.js, etc.]

-----

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the User Access Management application up and running on your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
  * **[Any specific database client, e.g., MongoDB Compass, psql client, MySQL Workbench]**

### Installation

This application consists of two main parts: the backend API and the frontend UI. Both need to be set up.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com//your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/thatikondaupendra/UAM.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

      * Navigate into the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend # Or whatever your backend folder is named (e.g., 'server', 'api')
        ```
      * Install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
      * **Configure Environment Variables:**
        Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (or specify its location if different). This file will contain sensitive information like database connection strings, JWT secrets, etc.
        ```
        # Example .env contentDB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5000
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=(PASS)
DB_DATABASE=uam
PORT=3000
        JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_key
        # Add any other necessary environment variables
        ```
        *(Refer to a `.env.example` file if provided in your backend, or mention what variables are needed.)*
      * **Database Migration/Initialization (if applicable, for SQL databases):**
        If you're using a SQL database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL) with an ORM (like Sequelize or TypeORM), you might need to run migrations.
        ```bash
        # Example command for migrations (if applicable to your backend setup)
        npm run migrate # or node your_migration_script.js
        ```
      * Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        npm run server # Or `node server.js`, `nodemon server.js`
        ```
        The backend API should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000` (or the PORT defined in your `.env`).

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

      * Open a **new terminal tab/window**.
      * Navigate back to the project root and then into the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd .. # Go back to the main project directory
        cd frontend # Or whatever your frontend folder is named (e.g., 'client', 'app')
        ```
      * Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
      * **Configure API Endpoint (if necessary):**
        Your React app will need to know where your backend API is running. This is often configured in a `.env` file in the frontend directory.
        ```
        # Example .env for frontend (in frontend folder)
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api # Adjust based on your backend port and API route
        ```
      * Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
        The frontend application should now be running, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend applications are running, here's how you can interact with the UAM system:

1.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  **Initial Setup (if applicable):**
      * **Create an Admin User:** If your application requires an initial admin user for setup, provide instructions here (e.g., through a specific API endpoint call or initial registration).
        *Example:* On first run, navigate to `/register` and create an account. The first registered user might automatically be assigned an 'admin' role, or you might need to manually update their role in the database for initial admin access.
3.  **User Management:**
      * Login with an administrative account.
      * Navigate to the "Users" section (or equivalent) in the UI.
      * Add new users, edit existing profiles, or deactivate accounts.
4.  **Role & Permission Management:**
      * Go to the "Roles" or "Permissions" section within the admin interface.
      * Create new roles (e.g., "Customer Service", "Product Manager").
      * Define specific permissions (e.g., "view\_reports", "edit\_users") and assign them to roles.
      * Assign roles to users to grant them access rights.
5.  **View Activity Logs:** Check the "Logs" or "Audit Trail" section (if available in the UI) to monitor user activities and system changes.
